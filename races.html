              Preparation and readiness are the hallmark of the Marad’Unn. Formerly 14 foot tall giants who could glimpse
              the future, the race now called the Dwarves (by some) were those that prepared the great Cairns and knew
              the fall would come. Though much was lost, the dwarves still prepare for what they cannot see. They are
              adorned in pouches and often hiding little trinkets or tools in their beards. What remains of their Sight
              prods them to collect these things for use later, though not all visions are accurate.
            </p>
            <p>
              Much is owed to these good people; their hospitality and humor are boundless and their sturdy shoulders

            <p>
              Called “The Fallen” by some, these elves from an alien world are the truest of outsiders. They are
              warriors and mystics of great power who traveled the planes to imprison and protect others from the Vreech.
              Calling themselves the Harbingers, those that reside with the people of the Protectorate are descendants of
              those who came to warn of the original Vreech threat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once unwilling allies to the Vreech on the condition the Vreech would not venture to other worlds, the
              Harbingers stood with the races of the Protectorate against the invaders. Some are still unsure if they
              brought the enemy themselves. It is well known of the Harbingers’ hatred for the Vreech and their
              sacrifices they have made to aid others. Their body glows with veins of the Ley lines they once guided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Know that when you stand next to a Harbinger and death is on the line, you had better be prepared to give
              everything because they will.

              The only group of elves that was separate before the Fall, the Jade Pact hold themselves to a strict code

              Elves struck a bargain, one that guaranteed the survival of the fae. The Jade Pact had no idea what shape
              that fulfillment would take, but remain honorable and have an attunement to nature that comes just shy of a
              Winnower. The Jade Pact are the silent strong hand of the Protectorate.

              Known as scientists and heroes, merchants and vagabonds, the Selunari were the masters of the old world.
              Their great families harnessed the powers of the crystals, and used them to build the ancient arcane
              machinery that ran the world. Their confidence in such arcane machinery may have been what brought the end
              so much quicker. They stood with the others at the site of the great ritual each family minding and
              assisting with the gigantic crystal pillars that now grow within them.

              The Selunari are seen in every facet of Cairn life, from the leaders of the collegium to hosting the many
              salons they run with the Union. No gathering or adventuring group is truly complete without one who
              resonates.

              The partial gold tint is all that remains of the once glorious and bright elves of the Celestial Chorus.
              Now relying on a mixture of what they knew and the newfound talent for controlling the emotions they now
              lack, these stalwart and serious elves help maintain the order while trying to understand the emotional and
              poignant world around them. The song and passion they had is not lost completely. The Sonorant are cool and
              impartial judges and negotiators.

              Their passions and harmonious spirit still inspires many.
