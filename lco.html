                <h2>We Are An Alliance</h2>
                <p>As a chapter of Alliance LARP, we share a large portion of our rules with our sister chapters. However, each chapter has a unique story to tell in a different part of the world of Fortannis. Below are detailed our rules that may not appear in other chapters or the Alliance Rule Book. Please familiarize yourself with these like you would with other Alliance rules.</p>

                <div class="rule-content">
                    <p>As part of previously announced policy change, all PCs will be doing a 4 hour shift (unless you purchased one of NPC Buyout slots). When you arrive onsite and go through logistics, there will be a sign up sheet that will have available slots for each of the shifts:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="shift-list">
                        <li><strong>10pm - 2am Friday</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>10am - 2pm Saturday</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>2pm - 6pm Saturday</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>10pm - 2am Saturday</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>9am - 1pm Sunday</strong></li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>On your shift you will be working with the full time NPCs to help create a more immersive and expansive world for the rest of PCs. There will be a large variety of roles and needs-from townsfolk to monsters. Once you are done with your shift and return, there are a variety of stories and information you can gain from your PC's escapades while you were offscreen (think mini-IBGA).</p>

                    <p>Not only does this policy make sure we have enough NPCs to tell a full story for everyone, it allows you to explore parts of the game and abilities that you may never have had the chance to use as your PC.</p>

                    <p>At Alliance NEPA, we want to make sure that people who go out of their way to lend a hand to the chapter get properly rewarded for their efforts! That's why we offer our players the Magic Item Pick List, from which anyone can "buy" Magic Items, scrolls, catalysts, or components using Goblin Stamps (or gobbies, for short).</p>

                    <h3>Requests</h3>
                    <p>Once you've confirmed that you are able to afford your chosen item, submit your request to the General Manager (<a href="mailto:nepagm@gmail.com">nepagm@gmail.com</a>) and Logistics (<a href="mailto:nepalogistics@gmail.com">nepalogistics@gmail.com</a>) at least two weeks before the next Alliance NEPA event.</p>

                    <p><strong>Subject: Magic Item Request</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Your name and character ID# from the CMA</li>
                        <li>Your chosen item rep, described succinctly (e.g. "Silver necklace w/ green jewel", "Black longsword w/ bear pommel", etc.)</li>
                        <li>The name of your new item (e.g. "Circlet of Protection")</li>
                        <li>Which rituals you would like on it</li>
                        <li>If you are picking scrolls, list which ones</li>
                        <li>For dual school/general aspect rituals, please choose an aspect (i.e., Earth, Celestial, or Necromantic). Otherwise, it will be chosen for you</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>All requested items should be picked up at Logistics at the next Ascension event unless noted otherwise.</p>

                    <h3>Earning Gobbies</h3>
                    <p>Gobbies are rewarded for the amount of time, work, resources, or funds a player has given to the chapter, for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fundraisers and donations</li>
                        <li>NPCing</li>
                        <li>Crafting (garb, props, weapons, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Work Weekends</li>
                        <li>Conventions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you're interested in giving your time to help Ascension, let us know! We always have projects in motion that could use your help.</p>

                    <h3>Limitations</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All requests are LCO (i.e., they do not travel to other chapters); LCO scrolls render their rituals/items/etc. LCO as well. This also means that they will count towards the 20-ritual Magic Item Cap.</li>
                        <li>Some chapters may accept others' LCO magic items, and you can check with the chapter you're traveling to by contacting their Logistics.</li>
                        <li>LCO rituals must be cast upon an item rather than the person's spirit unless an alternative is specifically offered on the Magic Item list.</li>
                        <li>Catalysts may only be purchased for the listed scrolls.</li>
                        <li>Rituals on requested items must be of the same aspect (i.e., Celestial, Earth, or Necromantic).</li>
                        <li>Each requested Magic Item may have a maximum of 10 rituals.</li>
                        <li>Preserve Duration is not on the purchasable list for Magic Items, so each item produced this way will have a standard duration of 20 logistics periods</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Request Limits</h3>
                    <p>A player may request one of the following list entries per event:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 Magic Item</li>
                        <li>2 Scrolls</li>
                        <li>1 Catalyst</li>
                        <li>5 Components</li>
                        <li>1 Scroll & 3 Components</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Costs</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Scrolls:</strong> See attached Scroll Cost list</li>
                        <li><strong>Magic Items:</strong> See attached Magic Item list</li>
                        <li><strong>Components:</strong> 50 gobbies each</li>
                        <li><strong>LCO Catalysts:</strong> 500 gobbies each</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                    <h3>Age Policy</h3>
                    <p>Alliance North-East Pennsylvania welcomes all players aged 14 and up at our games. Before deciding to bring an underage participant to an Alliance game, please keep in mind that while we aim for a PG-13 environment, we run a game primarily populated by adults in intense situations, violently combating monsters in the dark.</p>

                    <p>There are no overt sexual themes to the game that we run, but strong language and violent encounters are common. Not only will different people have different levels of tolerance for the dramatic situations they find themselves in, but not all younger players will have the level of maturity necessary to participate in a complex game among adults. Should you feel that a young player is mature and capable enough to participate at our events, we welcome them to try our game.</p>

                    <p>Due to physical safety concerns, there are a few restrictions regarding their ability to participate:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Players under 18 years old must have a parent or legal guardian on-site as a PC or NPC. They are responsible for the player's actions, and must remove the player from the site if asked. They must keep track of the player and be able to know where the player is at all times.</li>
                        <li>Players under 16 years old must have their consent form signed by a parent or legal guardian. This must also include contact info and medical/allergy information in case of emergency.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Page Status</h3>
                    <p>There are two ways in which a player may become a page:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Any player may participate as a page voluntarily.</li>
                        <li>Any player may be informed by staff that they must participate as a page based on medical issues, safety concerns, or age. Players under 16 years old require the Chapter's Owners, Head of Rules, and the participant's on-site parent or guardian are satisfied that they will be able to participate safely.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3>Page Rules</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>All Pages must wear an orange headband with the word page written on it large enough to be visible from 10 feet away. This must be worn at all times. At night Pages are required to wear an orange light or "glow stick" to denote them as a Page throughout the night.</li>
                        <li>Pages can participate in combat but can only carry bow or crossbow phys reps and throw packets. They can also only be hit with packets, with the exception of medical pages, depending on the reason for Paging.</li>
                        <li>Pages may carry other in-game items, and can be searched as per the search rules.</li>
                        <li>Pages must keep themselves a minimum of 10 feet from combat. Additional distance may be required to prevent combat from sweeping into their position before they can safely remove themselves.</li>
                        <li>Any page hit by a melee weapon in combat is required to immediately call a Hold. Any player who sees a page being hit by a melee weapon in combat is required to immediately call a Hold.</li>
                        <li>If a page is subject to an effect that would prevent them from leaving a combat area the page should call a Hold and move themselves away from combat, keeping the effect once the Lay On is called. (Example: The Web effect)</li>
                        <li>While a Page may not be subject to an attack with a melee weapon, any one carrying a melee weapon may point it at the page and state, "Page, &lt;qualifier&gt; &lt;effect&gt;" using their normal attack verbal and the page must take that effect, calling any applicable defenses available in response.</li>
                        <li>A Page character must be built in the Freeplay CMA. The player must advise the Logistics team in advance so the card can be printed. Pages may not purchase weapon skills or any skills or abilities that require the use of a weapon with the exception of bows and crossbows.</li>
                        <li>Medical Pages available skills and combat abilities will be determined on a case by case basis, based on the medical reasons for Paging.</li>
