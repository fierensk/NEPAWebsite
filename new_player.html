              <p>
                Well howdy! Welcome to to our corner of the world. Whatever you’ve heard about LARP, anything you’ve seen,
                it is either amazingly true or annoyingly false. At our core, we’re a bunch of fantasy nerds who like to
                play D&amp;D in the woods, incorporating costumes, combat, and plenty of improv.
              </p>
              <p>
                While I’ve tried my best to describe it here, in the end those parts do not add up to the whole.
                The whole is so, so much more. The stories we weave together are fascinating, hilarious, and heart wrenching.
                Everyone has something to add- including you! Come give it a shot, we’ve always got extra costumes and
                weapons around for a curious mind.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you’re still with me, I’d heartily recommend a bit of reading before your first event. I honestly think
                that giving the Rulebook a read as well as our Lore (racial descriptions and short stories)
                is worth it, at least “The Story So Far” and the Laws of Bastion
                (the name of our settlement).

            <p>
              The big idea. The character. Who they are, what they want, those sort of things. If you have a concept already, great!
              If not, we can help. I’d recommend checking out our <a href="/races.html">Heritages</a>, to best mesh your ideas
              with the world at large, or even build someone wholly new.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you’ve got a picture in mind, it’s time to take a step closer to making them real. Hit the
              <a href="https://db.alliancelarp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMA</a>, our character builder, and sign up and be on your merry
              character-creation way. The rulebook is your best friend here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our <a href="https://discord.gg/FMtQY3B3sV" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Discord</a> and
              <a href="https://alliancelarp.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forums</a> are full of people that love to talk build and rules—
              if you’re struggling at all, reach out! On top of that, we ask that you submit a backstory to us so we can weave your character and
              their goals into the plot of our LARP.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you submit it, expect a possible “Yes, and” or “No, but” as plot aligns your character with what’s canon in our world!
              We ask that you submit them to <a href="mailto:ascensionlarpplot@gmail.com">ascensionlarpplot@gmail.com</a> as soon as possible
              before you play to give our team some time to work with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once that’s settled, its time to build your character on yourself. Each race has its costume requirements as well as suggestions on
              how to dress in addition to those requirements. All we ask is do the best you can—leather boots, some baggy pants, and a tunic goes
              a long way. On top of costuming, any combat implements are important to physically own, or make a point to at least ask for loaners
              before the event.

                So picture this: you arrive on the site on Friday evening. You’ve registered, paid, and claimed a spot in one of the cabins.
                Some people are all dressed already and talking while others run around with their bags to unpack.
              </p>
              <p>
                You quickly get in garb and walk over the grass to the logistics area. You’re marked as present, given your character sheet and any
                wealth or tags you need, along with an estimate on when the game is to start.
              </p>
              <p>
                Maybe you go back to the cabin and touch up your look or maybe wander into the crowd in the tavern and start chatting them up.
                The fun thing is, the people you meet now, before the start of game, may be completely different than the faces they wear during game.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once everything is squared away and a staff member gives you an introduction, its time. From there, the weekend will consist of fights,
                quests, puzzles, and laughter. Remember to hydrate and shower—see you on the other side!
